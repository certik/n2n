Edge node
---------

You need to start an egde node on each host you want to connect with the *same*
community.

0. become root

1. create tun device
# tunctl -t tun0

3. enable the edge process
# ./edge -d n2n0 -c mynetwork -k encryptme -u 99 -g 99 -m 3C:A0:12:34:56:78 -a 1.2.3.4 -l a.b.c.d:xyw
 or
# N2N_KEY=encryptme ./edge -d n2n0 -c mynetwork -u 99 -g 99 -m 3C:A0:12:34:56:78 -a 1.2.3.4 -l a.b.c.d:xyw


Supernode
--------

You need to start the supernode once

1. ./supernode -l 1234 -v


Dropping Root Privileges and SUID-Root Executables
--------------------------------------------------

The edge node uses superuser privileges to create a TAP network interface
device. Once this is created root privileges are not required and can constitute
a security hazard if there is some way for an attacker to take control of an
edge process while it is running. Edge will drop to a non-privileged user if you
specify the -u <uid> and -g <gid> options. These are numeric IDs. Consult
/etc/passwd.

You may choose to install edge SUID-root to do this:

1. Become root
2. chown root:root edge
3. chmod +s edge
done

Any user can now run edge. You may not want this, but it may be convenient and
safe if your host has only one login user.
