.SH DESCRIPTION
N2N is a peer-to-peer VPN system. Supernode is a node introduction registry,
broadcast conduit and packet relay node for the n2n system. On startup supernode
begins listening on the specified UDP port for node registrations, and other
packets to route. The supernode can service any number of communities and routes
packets only between members of the same community. The supernode does not hold
the community encryption key and so cannot snoop or inject packets into the
community.
