.SH NAME
edge \- n2n edge node daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B edge
[\-d <tun device>] \-a <tun IP address> \-c <community> \-k <encrypt key> \-l <supernode host:port> [\-p <local port>] [\-u <UID>] [\-g <GID>] [\-m <MAC address>] [\-t] [\-r] [\-v]
.SH DESCRIPTION
N2N is a peer-to-peer VPN system. Edge is the edge node daemon for n2n which
creates a TAP interface to expose the n2n virtual LAN. On startup n2n creates
the TAP interface and configures it then registers with the supernode so it can
begin to find other nodes in the community.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-d
sets the TAP device name as seen in ifconfig.
.TP
\-a
sets the n2n LAN IP address being claimed.
.TP
\-c
sets the n2n community name.
.TP
\-k
sets the twofish encryption key from ASCII text (see also N2N_KEY in ENVIRONMENT)
.TP
\-l
sets the n2n supernode IP address and port to register to
.TP
\-p
binds to the given UDP port
.TP
\-u
causes the edge process to drop to the given user ID when privileges are no longer required
.TP
\-g
causes the edge process to drop to the given group ID when privileges are no longer required
.TP
\-m
start the TAP interface with the given MAC address. This is highly recommended
as it means the same address will be used if edge stops and restarts. If this is
not done, the ARP caches of all peers will be wrong and packets will not flow to
this edge until the next ARP refresh.
.TP
\-t
use HTTP tunneling instead of the normal UDP mechanism (experimental)
.TP
\-r
all packet forwarding/routing through the n2n virtual LAN
.TP
\-v
use verbose logging
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B N2N_KEY
set the encryption key so it is not visible on the command line
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B edge \-d n2n0 \-c mynetwork \-k encryptme \-u 99 \-g 99 \-m DE:AD:BE:EF:01:23 \-a 192.168.254.7 \-l 123.121.120.119:7654

Start edge with TAP device n2n0 on community "mynetwork" with community
supernode at 123.121.120.119 UDP port 7654. Use "encryptme" as the shared
encryption key. Assign MAC address DE:AD:BE:EF:01:23 to the n2n interface and
drop to user=99 and group=99 after the TAP device is successfull configured.
.PP
.SH EXIT STATUS
edge is a daemon and any exit is an error
