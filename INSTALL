RPM Package
-----------

These steps should work with RPM based Linux distributions since rpmbuild was
split from the rpm utility (c RedHat 9).

To build an RPM follow these steps.

$ cp -a n2ndir n2n-1.0
$ tar czf n2n-1.0.tar.gz n2n-1.0
$ mv n2n-1.0.tar.gz /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
$ cp n2ndir/n2n.spec /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
$ rpmbuild -bb n2n.spec
